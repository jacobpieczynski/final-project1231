Without randomness, with random random_state in test each time, 50 trials:
accuracy 56.5497%

With 100 trials:
accuracy 56.02%

With 200 trials:
accuracy 56.07109%

Randomness included 1, 100 trials:
accuracy 55.55118%

Randomness included 2, 100 trials:
accuracy 55.99857%

Randomness included 3, 100 trials:
accuracy 55.17061%
Average across 3 rounds: 55.57345%

Just to confirm, no randomness, 100 trials:
accuracy 55.9289%

Overall, randomness seems to harm the model instead of help


Tested data without OPS - I believe it is too collinear with other slg and obp, 100 trials:
accuracy 55.70142%

Round 2, 100 trials:
accuracy 56.3744%

Round 3, 100 trials:
accuracy 55.3838%
Average across 3 rounds: 55.8198%

OPS Doesn't seem to have a large impact on the accuracy - about .3%?


Tested data without OPS and batting average, 100 trials:
accuracy 55.82938%

Round 2, 100 trials:
accuracy 55.96208%

Round 3, 100 trials:
accuracy 55.50171%
Average across 3 rounds: 55.76439%


Tested without scaling data, 100 trials:
accuracy 55.6066%
Scaling helps

Dummy trial 1 of Random Forest - initially to find variable importance:
accuracy (only 10 trials) 54.78%

Including Park Data (CATEGORICAL) - back to LR, 100 trials:
accuracy 55.8996%

Removed Park Data and Dummies:

With Home Win Difference (should be correct calc), i swear to god if this doesn't improve accuracy i'll kms:
accuracy 56.456% (I LIVE TO SEE ANOTHER DAY)

accuracy 56.242

1000 trials (for shits and giggles) with dummies:
accuracy 56.31%

1000 trials (no home win difference) iwth dummies:

------------------
100 Trials (new day, setting baseline):
accuracy 56.5205%

With Home Loss Diff - shouldn't see major differences:
accuracy 56.3333%

With Difference in team average hits:
accuracy 55.3196%

With difference in total team hits instead of average:
accuracy 56.4474%

With all hit type totals - using the difference between the two, e.g. diff in singles, or triples:
accuracy 56.2009%

Removing total hits, just the specific types of hits
accuracy 55.99999%

Trying all hit type totals again
accuracy 55.52511%

Trying one more time
accuracy 55.7534%

Just Hits difference

Trying hits difference a final time
accuracy 56.0228%

Including only hits difference and SOs difference:
accuracy 56.3562%

Including all differences:
accuracy 56.105%

Running again with updated main and write function - removed specific hit differences, only keeping SOs and hits:
accuracy 56.49315%

Total team walks added:
accuracy 56.853%

Total team runs added:
accuracy 56.479%

Without OPS difference, I think it would lead to an overfit:
accuracy 56.840%

Without run differential and OPS difference:
accuracy 56.7625%

Same factors, but with scikit built in LR model:
